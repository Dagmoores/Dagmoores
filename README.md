### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel, I live in Brazil and I'm a studying Computer Engineering and learning how to programming. I already know a little about JavaScript, HTML, Python and C++, but I want to learn much more!

I love to play games, so I hope I can work programming one some day, my favorite game is Quest For Glory.
